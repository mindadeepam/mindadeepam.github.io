Hi Y'all. My name is Deepam Minda and this is my website. I'll be writing a lot more blogs, TILs, etc about various things that interest me. I'm interested in topics like AI, llms, and tech in general. 

I am a data scientist/ML engineer at [Farmart](https://www.farmart.co/) by profession. I graduated from Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India. Apart from this, I also ocassionally dabble with a bit of guitar, and like everyone sane, music in general.

I am always inspired and fascinated by excellent blogs maintained by people online where they share all sorts of cool stuff. I hope you learn something new here. Feel free to share your thoughts or hit me up.

Cheers!

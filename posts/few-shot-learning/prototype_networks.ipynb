    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren’t already familiar with it, few-shot learning (FSL) is an exciting concept in machine learning that focuses on training models to make accurate predictions or classifications when provided with only a very limited amount of labeled data for each category or class. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches that often require substantial labeled datasets for training, few-shot learning aims to address scenarios where acquiring such extensive labeled data is impractical or costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In few-shot learning, the model is trained to generalize effectively from a small number of examples (or shots) per category, allowing it to make predictions for new, unseen data points with confidence. This capability is particularly valuable in situations where data is scarce, and manual annotation is labor-intensive or expensive. Refer to [1] for an in-depth survey in this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog, I’m going to show you how to implement a basic few-shot classification technique for text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "Before we begin, let us familiarize ourselves with the correct terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "What characterizes FSL is having only a few examples at hand, for unseen classes, during inference. So basically we are showing the model only a few examples of a class which it may or may not have encountered during its pre-training before we make predictions using that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Set, 𝒮:** The few annotated examples that we have, make up the support set, with which we may or may not update the model weights to make it generalize to the new classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query Set, 𝒬:** The query set consists of our test set, i.e. the samples we want to classify using the base model and a support set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N-way K-shot learning scheme:** This is a common phrase used in the FSL literature, which essentially describes the few-shot problem statement that a model will be dealing with. “N” is the number of classes we have at test time and “K” is the number of samples per class we have in our support set “𝒮”\n",
    "\n",
    "**1-shot classification:** When K=1, i.e. we have only one labeled sample available per class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0-shot classification:** K=0, i.e. we do not have any labeled samples available during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us have a look at an example.\n",
    "\n"

    "This is the flow of our solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to get an embedding module. That can be created using regular supervised learning (Resnets trained on Imagenet) or self-supervised learning (BERT and co).\n",
    "Then, we use the embedding module to get feature representations for our classes in the support set. A simple way to do this is to turn each class’s examples into embeddings and take the mean of those vectors. This then becomes our “prototype” vectors to compare against.\n",
    "Now for each query, we can take the embeddings of the query text and use cosine similarity to find the predicted class. This closely resembles\n",
    "This system basically allows us to leverage transfer learning to use large backbones as our embedding module. And there is also the advantage of not performing any gradient updates. This helps us maintain a much more dynamic and flexible system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of comparing query samples with the support set samples is inspired by metric learning. Refer to [3, 4] for better understanding.\n",

It seems that this is is doing average pooling over the word tokens to get a sentence vector, but we never suggested that this will generate meaningful sentence representations.

    "This brings us to the end of this blog. In summary, we explored the realm of few-shot learning, a machine-learning approach tailored for accurate predictions with limited labeled data. Initially, we employed BERT, but its design didn’t align with our objectives. Instead, we leveraged a model fine-tuned for sentence-level tasks, `sentence-transformers/stsb-bert-base`, which significantly improved our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**These are a few things to note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we directly used pre-trained models here, an interesting undertaking would be to perform the contrastive fine-tuning ourselves. Also, instead of using cosine similarity, we can train lightweight classifiers on top of our embedding module for better performance.\n",
